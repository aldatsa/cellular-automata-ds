FIXED ????-??-?? * Avoid the possibility of the pixel size of the Langton's ant being zero.
FIXED ????-??-?? * Due to the new implementation (I use only one array for all the boolean rules) the rules for the Von Neumann neighborhood change
                   when I change the rules for the Moore neighborhood (and the other way around).
FIXED 2012-05-?? * ECA shows incorrect rule number in the first run after selecting it from the automata selection menu. In next runs works correctly. 
                   In the first run after switching on the ROM shows 255, in next runs show the last value. Probably is initialized but not shown.
FIXED 2012-05-08 * Avoid the possibility of the value of the first boolean rule being zero.
FIXED 2012-05-10 * Avoid the possibility of the value of the first boolean rule being zero. (New implementation)
FIXED 2012-05-11 * Fix Langton's ant pixel size selection in the Langton's ant menu. When the size changes from 10 to 9 there's an extra '>': < 9 >>
FIXED 2012-05-26 * In the Elementary Cellular Automata the count of alive cells in the previous step is printed instead of the count in the current one. Why?
FIXED 2012-05-27 * The alive cells from the top row (row #0) are not included in the population of alive cells in the ECA

* Changing the rules of the neighborhood that is not currently selected should not initialize the automata in the Boolean Square and Triangular Automata.

FIXED 2012-07-02 * Can't go back to the main menu from the munching squares menu:

    intArrow should be 0 here:
        if (intArrow == 4)
